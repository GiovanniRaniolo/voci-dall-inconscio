## üí≠ The Concept

"Voci dall'Inconscio" explores the raw, unfiltered expressions that emerge from the unconscious mind. These "regurgitated poems" (poesie vomitate) represent authentic emotional states, captured in their nascent form without the sanitization of excessive editing.

The digital presentation aims to honor this authenticity by creating an environment where each verse can be experienced in isolation, allowing for deeper contemplation of its meaning and emotional resonance.
